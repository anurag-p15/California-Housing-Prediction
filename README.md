Following are the questions and analogies have been attempted and looked at it to solve at during the analysis

1.  **What is the average median house value?**
2.  **What is the distribution of `ocean_proximity`?** How many properties are there for each category of proximity to the ocean?
3.  **What are the summary statistics for `housing_median_age`?** (mean, median, standard deviation, min, and max).
4.  **What is the range of `median_income` in the dataset?**
5.  **How many unique values are there in the `ocean_proximity` column?**
6.  **What is the total population in this dataset?**
7.  **What is the average number of rooms per household?**



8.  **Is there a correlation between `median_income` and `median_house_value`?**
9.  **How does `ocean_proximity` relate to the `median_house_value`?** Do houses closer to the ocean have a higher median value?
10. **What is the relationship between the total number of rooms and the total number of bedrooms?**
11. **Which `ocean_proximity` category has the oldest houses on average?**
12. **Is there a geographical pattern in the `median_house_value`?** Can you spot any high-value or low-value clusters based on latitude and longitude?
13. **How does the population density (population per household) vary across different `ocean_proximity` categories?**
14. **What is the relationship between the age of a house (`housing_median_age`) and its value (`median_house_value`)?**


15. **Can you build a model to predict the `median_house_value` using the other features?**
16. **Which features are the most important in predicting the `median_house_value`?**
17. **Are there any outliers in the `total_rooms` or `population` columns?** How might these outliers affect your analysis, and how could you handle them?
18. **Can you create a new feature from `longitude` and `latitude` that improves a predictive model?** For example, the distance to a major city or the coast.
19. **Does the relationship between `median_income` and `median_house_value` differ for various `ocean_proximity` categories?**
